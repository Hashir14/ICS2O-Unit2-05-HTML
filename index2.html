    <h2 style="color:DarkGoldenRod;"> Rule One: Write On The Lines!</h2>
    <p style="color:Brown;font-size:120%;">Many people do not write on the lines when writing in pencil or any writing utensil for that matter. Say for example that this text is written perfectly between two lines on a notebook. Many peoeple either<sub>write like this</sub><sup>or they write like this</sup>. Not writing on the line makes your writing look messy and unprofessional. People won't want to read it no matter how great the content is.</p>
    <h2 style="color:DarkGoldenRod;">Rule Two: Always Erase!</h2>
    <p style="font-size:120%;color:Brown;">The worst thing a pencil user can do with a pencil is to not erase when they make a mistake. The eraser is there for a reason. Many people, just out of pure laziness, simply just cross out their mistakes like this: <del>Peopel</del> People who <del>scrach</del> scratch out <del>they're</del> their <del>righting</del> writing make themselves look lazy. As Tommy Lasorda once said, <q>Everyone makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils.</q>
    <h2 style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Rule 3: Proper Quotaions!</h2>
    <p style="color:Brown;font-size:120%;"> The error that annoys most evaluators the most is when you use incorrect quotations. Some people either quote 'like this' or `like this`. The proper way to quote is like <q>this</q> with two small brackets on each side. Not one bracket, not two apostrophes on each side. No! Two small brackets on each side.
