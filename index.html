    <p style="font-size:125%;color:SlateBlue;"><b>There are many types of HTML tags out there. Today we will focus on some specific tags that can help your webpage to look as eye-opening as this one!</b></p>
    <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;color;">Bold Text</h2>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Bold text can help your titles and important text <b>pop</b>. For example, the text below is written in bold and without bold so you can see which better grabs your attention.<br><br><span style="color:Black"><b>Bold text is better than plain text.</b><br>Bold text is better than plain text.</span></p>
    <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Italic Text</h2>

    <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Be Creative With Text</h2>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Playing around with your text keeps your audience engaged. For example, if I wrote the same sentence, but with a weird flow design, would it make you pay more attention to it?<br><br><span style="color:black;">This plain old text is so boring to read.</span><br><br>This<sup>plain</sup>old<sup>text</sup>is<sup>so</sup>boring<sup>to</sup>read.
    <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Colours</h2>
